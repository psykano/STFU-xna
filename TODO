Currently:
- dashing
	- dashing trails in representation
		- store currentAnimation draw call in some list (or copy the animation...)
		- determine a set time to draw the previous frames
		- essentially, I need that pixel shader effect in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uZvurrhig

- hit stun (probably only when hit by another player in versus)

- make mines (the exploding kind, not the exploring kind)

- make experience+gold
	- gold drops on every hit
	- experience drops when enemy dies

- add more enemies

- add more weapons


Eventually:
- refactor physics classes

- EnemyVision is a bit wonky at times and slow. try using sensors?

- refactor bat and walker enemy classes so they use common method stuff

- what's going on with the maximum layerDepth for different resolutions..?


To think about:
- give players a dash ability?

- make it so player can look down/up to see what's down/up?

- start with armor and then after hit armor comes back after a long 
cooldown?

- make it so players shoot _through_ each other rather than hit each 
other with their shots?
