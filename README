Super Team Fighters Unite!

There is TODO describing what I'm currently working on.
In the meantime, there's a prototype of the game with multiplayer functionality but no way to win and no way to change levels.

XNA Game Studio is required to compile the source.
XNA 4.0 Redistributable and the .NET framework are required to run the game.

Up to four Xbox 360 controllers can be used for four different players.
Otherwise, keyboard controls are
For player 1:
- Arrow keys for movement
- N is jump
- M is gun
- , is sword

For player 2:
- WASD for movement
- Tab is jump
- Q is gun
- 1 is sword

+ adds a player and - subtracts a player.

Some more keys that do stuff are
- F1: hides debug info
- F4: fullscreen
- F5: v-sync
- F6: change resolution but only in fullscreen
- F10: show the physics debug view
