Super Team Fighters Unite!

There is a TODO describing what I'm currently working on.
In the meantime, there's a prototype of the game with multiplayer functionality but no way to win and no way to change levels. The latest binaries are in the RAR file.

XNA Game Studio is required to compile the source.
XNA 4.0 Redistributable and the .NET framework are required to run the game.

Up to four Xbox 360 controllers can be used for four different players. Controls can be remapped in InputSettings.ini.
Otherwise, default keyboard controls are
For player 1:
- Arrow keys for movement
- B is dash
- N is jump
- M is gun
- , is sword

For player 2:
- WASD for movement
- `(tilde) is dash
- Tab is jump
- Q is gun
- 1 is sword

+ adds a player and - subtracts a player.

Some more keys that do stuff are
- F1: hides debug info
- F4: fullscreen
- F5: v-sync
- F6: change resolution but only in fullscreen
- F10: show the physics debug view

Additional info:
I apologize for the overall lack of comments and hacky physics code. Originally, this was going to be a prototype for testing out XNA and Farseer. It turned out a lot better than expected and so I decided to turn it into a full-fledged open source game.
You might also notice the lack of design documentation or any kind of documentation. That's because I use an incremental development method, setting smaller goals rather than larger ones so I can push out working builds more often. I have some principles I'd like to maintain and some general ideas of where I'd like to drive the game but nothing is set in stone. Using this strategy, I try to keep things abstract but not to the point of creating a game engine.
You'll also notice the lack of sound. That's because I have very little knowledge of sound design. So while I'd like to get to that eventually, it's being put off right now. I'd like to go with 8-bit sound effects and music.
