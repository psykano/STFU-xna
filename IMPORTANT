Jumping (and possibly other) problems:
- it's good from 30fps and up, at least

For character's hitboxes, the usual is:
- 3 pixels off for width; 4 pixels off for height



If ever upgrading Farseer:
- remember that there's a bug in world.RayCast where it should return
	return rayCastInput.MaxFraction;

- there's a bug in Contact.cs in "if (wasTouching == false && touching)" where it should also check for
	if (FixtureA != null) and if (FixtureB != null)
before checking whether the respective OnCollision functions are null

- I added the following in Body.Disposed() in if (!IsDisposed)
		ContactEdge contactEdge = ContactList;
                Contact contact;
                while (contactEdge != null && (contact = contactEdge.Contact) != null)
                {
                    //Report the separation to both participants:
                    if (contact.FixtureA != null && contact.FixtureA.OnSeparation != null)
                        contact.FixtureA.OnSeparation(contact.FixtureA, contact.FixtureB);

                    //Reverse the order of the reported fixtures. The first fixture is always the one that the
                    //user subscribed to.
                    if (contact.FixtureB != null && contact.FixtureB.OnSeparation != null)
                        contact.FixtureB.OnSeparation(contact.FixtureB, contact.FixtureA);

                    contactEdge = contactEdge.Next;
                }
